TODO list:

1. Decide on how to average out the data.
    Options:
        1.Average by ACCELERATION
            1.1 Average like every 10,11,n readings
            1.2 Average by "local maximum." Scan the data and average numbers between "big" jumps.
                ex. 0.001,0.0012,0.0018,0.0031,0.0033,0.101,0.102,0.110
                to avg to 0.0015, 0.0032, 0.105

        2.Average by coordinates
            2.1 Average every 10,11,n coordinates
            2.2 Average as in example above.

        TAKE NOTE:
            Number of average coordinates NEEDS to be same for all axis

2. Make the basic GUI


Currently working:
    1.Loading CSV file to database
        1.1 Prevention of multiple same files to get loaded
        1.2 Returning the key data like id,internalid,externalid while loading CSV
    2.Exporting CSV file to database
    3.Importing CSV file to database
        Automaticly deletes content from database and loads in new content
    4.Returning list of added files
    5.Deleting the database if user wants to
    6.Initialise the database after deleting if user wants to
    7.Returning the coordinates based on acceleation data
